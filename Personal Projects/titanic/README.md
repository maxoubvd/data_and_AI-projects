# Titanic Machine Learning Project

This is my very first Kaggle project! It's a basic machine learning model designed to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would survive.

## Steps

- Data Analysis and Preprocessing
- Building a Basic Machine Learning (ML) Model
- Attempting to Build a Basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model, but the Machine Learning Model Proves More Accurate (likely due to insufficient data for the ANN)
